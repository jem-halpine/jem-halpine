## Projects

### Tag Hunter
Tag Hunter was my team's week long final project for Dev Academy. It is a fun web application game, similar to GeoGuessr, where the user sees a piece of street art somewhere in Wellington, and uses a map to guess its location, then feedback is given for how geographically close their guess was. I worked on implementing user authorisation using Auth0 and managed user profiles with secure data handling. Please give it a try [here](https://taghunter-mako-kotare-2024.pushed.nz/) and feel free to get out the [repo.](https://github.com/jem-halpine/tag-hunter)


### Troll Toll Calculator
Troll Toll Calculator was a teacher-led group project for Dev Academy. It's a fun app where the users can view, favourite, patrol, and keep track on tolls for Auckland bridges, as if they were a troll patrolling them. I worked on the favourite functionality of the app. Feel free to check out the repo [here.](https://github.com/jem-halpine/troll-toll-calculator)
